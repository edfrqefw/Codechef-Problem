Question
You are given a positive integer N. Consider a square grid of size NÃ—N, with rows numbered 1 to N from top to bottom and columns numbered 1 to N from left to right. 
Initially you are at (1,1) and you have to reach (N,N). From a cell you can either move one cell to the right or one cell down (if possible). Formally, if you are 
at (i,j), then you can either move to (i+1,j) if i<N, or to (i,j+1) if j<N.
There are exactly N blocks in the grid, such that each row contains exactly one block and each column contains exactly one block. You can't move to a cell which contains 
a block. It is guaranteed that blocks will not placed in (1,1) and (N,N).
You have to find out whether you can reach (N,N)
