Question
Chef has a sequence of N integers A1,A2,…,AN. He defines a function f(i,j) as follows:  
      f(i,j)=Ai + max(Ai,Ai+1) + max(Ai,Ai+1,Ai+2) + ⋯ + max(Ai,Ai+1,…,Aj)    
Chef tries to find the sum of f(i,j) over all (i,j) such that 1≤i≤j≤N (i.e∑i=1n∑j=inf(i,j)), but fails. Can you help him find the sum? Since the sum can be very large, 
find it modulo (109+7).
Note: Since the size of the input and output is large, please use fast input-output methods.
