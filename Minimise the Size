Question
Consider an array A={a1,a2,...,an} of size n≥1. If ak=2x−1 for all 1≤k≤n, for some integer x (1≤x≤60), then A is called interesting array. You are given a number C. 
Find any interesting array A of minimum possible size such that a1⨁a2⨁...⨁an=C, where ⨁ represents bitwise XOR operation. If there exists multiple such arrays, 
output any one.
