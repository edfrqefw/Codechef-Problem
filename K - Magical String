Question
You have been given a string S of size N which consists of uppercase characters only. A K-Magical String is a string in which the longest non - decreasing subsequence is 
of size exactly K.
You have been given Q queries where each query is in the form L,R, and K. For each query, check whether substring from index L to index R can be converted into a K-Magical 
String or not by rearranging its characters and print the final rearranged string too.
If there exist multiple answers, print the lexicographically largest string possible.
Note:
  1. Each query will be treated independently i.e. after each query the string will remain the same as it was initially.
  2. The input files are large. The use of Fast I/O is recommended.
